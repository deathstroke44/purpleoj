<p>I&#39;ve been thinking recently about this topic, and how this community can leave it&#39;s greatest impact on society.</p><p>Competitive programmers have done some impressive things. Examples include Quora co-founder and ex-Facebook CTO <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_D%27Angelo">Adam D&#39;Angelo</a>, Ethereum inventor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitalik_Buterin">Vitalik Buterin</a> and more recently Jakub Pachoki (meret)&#39;s contribution to building a world class AI, that beat the best humans at Dota2.</p><p>Overall, I think the awesome talent in this community can accomplish even greater things. The greatest challenges I see are organizational though. I know how hard it was for me to get into software development coming as a self-taught programmer. I had great self-doubt that I could be a developer for a while, mostly because of how intimidating it was to be completely unknowing at &quot;real world&quot; coding, which made want even more to do the thing I was good at: writing a C++ program that read some input and writes some output.</p><p>Understanding that maintainable and easy to read code is more important than almost everything else was something that took me a long time to internalize.</p><p>It&#39;s also a lot harder to stay focused for longer periods of time after getting used to solving algorithmic challenges. Before you got a feeling of accomplishment every time you solved a problem or understood a new algorithm/data structure. In complex software projects you may need to carry on for days or weeks at a time without receiving that endorphin kick, and you just need to</p><p>Worst of all was figuring out this transition on my own. It&#39;s a lot better now, with online tutorials, yet very few of them try to help you with the needed mentality change, just focusing on teaching you syntax. In writing the tutorial for our open-source framework, I really hope to address this as well.</p><p>We want to make CS Academy into the best platform you can build, to help the community of algorithmics enthusiasts fulfill their potential. Please help us by answering the questionnaire above and letting us know in what directions we could work with the community to better it.</p><p><a href="https://csacademy.com/blog/">Back to the Main Blog</a></p>
