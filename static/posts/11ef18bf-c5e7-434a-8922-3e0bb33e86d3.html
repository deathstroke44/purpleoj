<p>&nbsp;</p><p>After two consecutive Div. 2 contests, we hosted another Div. 1 + Div. 2. The hard problems of the round were authored by <strong>tourist</strong>. We&#39;d like to thank him for all the effort he&#39;s put into preparing the tasks.</p><p>The notoriety of the author attracted a large number of people, and once again, we broke the records of registered users and users who submitted at least one solution. Over <strong>500</strong> people managed to solve at least one problem.</p><p>Initially, we were planning on having a regular round with <strong>7</strong> problems and a constest duration of <strong>2</strong> hours. While preparing <a href="https://csacademy.com/contest/archive/task/tree-antichain-hard/">Tree Anitchain (Hard)</a>, <strong>tourist</strong> thought it&#39;s a really nice problem to ask for any valid permutation, not necessarily the first lexicographical one. This is how <a href="https://csacademy.com/contest/archive/task/tree-antichain-easy/">Tree Antichain (Easy)</a> was born. We decided to increase the contest duration to <strong>2</strong> hours and <strong>30</strong> minutes. It&#39;s interesting to note that the best strategy was to jump straight to the hard version, and then just submit the same code for the easy one. However, only <strong>8</strong> out of the <strong>24</strong> users who solve both did this. Missing on the optimal strategy didn&#39;t stop <strong>Cat Snuke</strong> from winning, though.</p><p>The second hardest problem, <a href="https://csacademy.com/contest/archive/task/parallel-lines">Parallel Lines</a>, was solved by <strong>10</strong> people, indicating a harder than usual task. Many others had lots of wrong submissions, hoping to exploit potentially weak tests. This was not the case, as <strong>tourist</strong> spent a lot of effort in order to fail wrong probabilistic solutions.</p><p>The last problem, <a href="https://csacademy.com/contest/archive/task/checkroom-hooks">Checkroom Hooks</a>, was really hard, with only <strong>2</strong> accepted solutions. Besides <strong>Cat Snuke</strong> and <strong>ksun48</strong>, <strong>Um_nik</strong> was really close to solving it too (he would&#39;ve won the contest).</p><p>We hope you had a great time participating.
